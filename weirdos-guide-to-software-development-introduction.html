                <p>Lets start this off with some of the basics:</p>
<h3>What is software and how does it differ from programs?</h3>
<p>This is a pretty loaded question especially because in modern parlance, these 2 terms are used pretty interchangeably, however its important to
understand that there is still a small difference between the two. A program is basically a set of instruction that can be run in a computer
as such we can say that every program is a type/piece of software, but software as a whole tends to encompass not only the programs but
also any documentation and any other components that are required to run the software. Lets take the example of Gmail. What most people
see about Gmail is its UI, however it also has a logic engine, a database, several servers, load balancers, etc configured and designed
to work together in what is undoubtedly one of the best online Email platforms available today.</p>
<h3>What does one do to make good software?</h3>
<p>Software development as a whole can be broken up into the following five activities:</p>
<p><strong>Requirement gathering, analysis and software specification:</strong></p>
<p>This involves speaking with the client and figuring out what actually needs to be made and noting it down in a specification document.
Sounds easy right? Well, its not. Ever heard the phrase, "God doesn't give people what they want, he gives them what they need"? Sadly, God
isn't in the mood to come down and tell you what your customer is actually looking for, and sadly your client is also usually not the font of
inspiration you would wish they were.</p>
<p>This really isn't their fault and if you want to be successful in this field you need to learn to be patient with non-techie people. Be
prepared to go into the minutiae of any and all software related topics and try to explain it as simply as you
can. This isn't limited to software, any professional in any field needs to be able to do this. Otherwise, whats the point of an expert that
no one else can understand?  How are you any different from that crazy person in the subway that keeps talking gibberish about mutant aliens?
Fun Fact, I have never actually met someone like this in the New York subways, I think they only exist in the comics/movies :(</p>
<p>This is probably one of the hardest jobs there is and its the one that will more often than not lead to the failure of the entire software
project. This is also one of the main reasons that business analysts exist. Turns out that a bunch of techie people aren't always the best
candidates to draw out quantifiable requirements from non-techies, go figure.</p>
<p><strong>Software Design:</strong></p>
<p>The second leading cause of project failure. Mostly, this step is closely related to the first but there have been plenty of instances where
having a reasonably accurate specification did not really help since the design was so bad that the project was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>This is the step that deals with a software's architecture. Its at this point that things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" title="Wikipedia on GOF book">design patters and GOF</a> come into play.
It is also the step that most newbs often ignore, preferring to jump straight into the next step. This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TxL-xk0V14" title="Arnie">big mistake</a>. If you do this,
you are literally wasting a huge part of your lifespan. Imagine you had to single-handedly fight off an army battalion tomorrow morning, you
could go in guns blazing, maybe kill one guy and then get pumped full of holes OR you could plan things out a little, get some land mines,
an artillery launcher and some shells, scope out a nice nest to launch artillery from and then just stay in one place and rain death on your
enemies.</p>
<p>Hmm, that might not be the nicest analogy, but I hope it gets my point across. My point is, take the time to figure out what you want to do
before you start doing it, not the other way around!</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>This is where you do your actual coding. The one thing people just want to jump into. Coincidentally this should tell you just how easy
the process of coding really is in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>I don't mean that coding by itself isn't actually important or difficult of course, you can't sell something, in this case software, that
hasn't been made. I just mean that the ability to create software is just considered as a given.
Kind of like how a fruit seller will have fruits to sell, otherwise they're not really a fruit seller.</p>
<p>If you ever reach a point in your coding cycle where you're not sure what the application is supposed to be doing and you're making stuff up
on the fly, then you didn't do the last step properly. Go back and fix it!</p>
<p>One thing to note is optimization. If you've finished the project, and can then profile your code and then spend a lot of time optimizing a slow section of it,
then congratulations! Your design was probably thorough and deadlines well planned so that after implementation you had time left over to
optimize the critical 3% of your code, you'd be surprised at how rarely this happens in the real world. In the real world, people
tend to get so hung up on minor details that the project easily overshoots all deadlines. There is a famous quote from a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.6084&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" title="Donald Knuth's paper">paper</a>(page 8)
by Donald Knuth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass
up our opportunities in that critical 3%. A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look
carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>At this point your initial application is ready for use and now you begin the arduous task of testing it to see if it works like its supposed to.
This role is often looked down upon by some but is actually VERY important and very sensitive. Its important because if your throwing
improperly tested software out into the wild badlands of production and at your customers, there is a pretty high chance, probably over 90%,
that your project is going to fail. And its sensitive because if you're a tester and you give your OK to a change that subsequently fails in
live production, then the boss is going to come for your head, not the guy who made it, usually at least.</p>
<p>Software Testing is a pretty broad field and if you want to get the into the details of it, then I suggest you read through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing" title="Wikipedia on Software Testing">this page</a>
to get an idea of what it entails.</p>
<p>Mostly, you won't be doing all the tests as outlined in the Wikipedia article, some companies, maybe even some Government projects may have
the time as well as the budget and the need to do full scale thorough testing, think of things like nuclear power plants, you can't
take even the smallest risk with those things. However most projects will only use a subset of them depending on their requirements. There is
however a core group of tests that is always performed. They are unit tests, integration tests and system tests.</p>
<p>They may not be labelled as such or maybe mish-mashed together depending on the needs of the project, but they are always performed on
any successful project.</p>
<p>Something else that is worth reading though I won't be mentioning it much here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" title="Wikipedia on TDD">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance &amp; Evolution</strong></p>
<p>Welcome the the war! You've now finished developing your software and it is live and available to the customers. This is where the real
battle begins. Some people seem to think that your job is over when you've made the software. Au contraire mon fraire, you've only just started.
You now have to fix any bugs that crop up, not to mention add any new features that your users need. Help them troubleshoot problems and use your
software effectively and make sure that its still compatible with the latest platform versions that you are targeting.</p>
<p>This is another part of software that people often tend to overlook but is actually VERY important.</p>
<hr />
<p>Okay! I think that's enough for basic theory, don't you? Lets get to the hands on development part shall we? Then lets go on to
